The main objective is to select the model that predicts credit card customer churning best by comparing them with the performance of different Machine Learning models using R. Customer churn is a common measure of lost customers. By minimizing customer churn, a company can maximize its profits. Companies recognize that existing customers are one of the most valuable assets a company could have and customer retention is critical for a good marketing strategy. The prevention of customer churn through customer retention is the core problem of Customer Relationship Management. Here, an analysis is done on purchasing behavior of bank customers from a certain dataset. A detailed analysis is worked out to convert raw customer data into meaningful and useful data that suits the buying behavior and in turn, converts this meaningful data into knowledge for which predictive data mining techniques are adopted.
